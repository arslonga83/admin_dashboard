Another OdinProject that seemed like it would take weeks but once it started to come together, was mapped out in less than a day! Since there were so many things to align, I did some experimenting with using Grid on some and Flex on others. It was pretty easy to get things to pop into place where I wanted using either...for spacing things evenly, Flex seems more natural to me, because I had trouble making the grids perfect when using different content items in each. I could probably remove more default styling to help with that next time.

It seems beyond the scope of this project to make any of the buttons work, so it is just a dummy page at this point. I got lots of practice with layout, and finding and importing all the different icons. I tried to use FR and REM units for most everything, except for the sidebar and header which I locked into place at what looked like the ideal size. I played with having the header be sticky, but it just seemed weird. 

One thing I definitely want to read more about is organizing CSS code...I tried to go in order through the HTML so they line up pretty well as you look through both, but I could see it quickly getting difficult to find something specific, or figure out where a certain style is coming from, once the project gets much larger.
